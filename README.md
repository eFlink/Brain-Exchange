INFS3202 Web Information Systems Course Project
This project repository contains the work I undertook for the course INFS3202 Web Information Systems, a comprehensive exploration into the latest technologies for web-based information system (WIS) development.

About
The course addressed the fundamentals and advanced aspects of WIS, including PHP, JavaScript, databases, client-server database applications on the internet, AJAX, web security, web search, and web service. It also shed light on the latest advancements in server-side technologies and the current trends in WIS.

For the course's practical component, I developed a website using PHP, HTML, and JavaScript within the CodeIgniter framework, demonstrating my skills in both front-end and back-end development. The website's functionality was meticulously crafted to meet the diverse requirements provided by the course.

Project Description
The project involved creating an Online Learning System, akin to platforms like Coursera or UQ's learning portal. This system provides a comprehensive platform for educators to upload content and students to access and download it.

Technically, I leveraged various client-side technologies to develop the front end, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For the back end, PHP and the CodeIgniter framework were employed. The project follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern and was deployed on the UQCloud zone.

Features Implemented
The website is equipped with a wide range of functionalities including but not limited to:

- User Login and Registration
- User Profile updating by adding course
- 'Remember Me' functionality using Cookies
- Bookmarks for course posts
- Adding and Writing Comments on posts
- Basic and Multiple File Uploading
- Making posts for courses
- Drag and Drop Files feature
- Search Box with Autocompletion
- Web Security measures including Password Encryption
- Maintaining Scroll Position
- A Recommendation Algorithm
- A  Management Dashboard 

Each feature was built in stages throughout the course duration, with the complete set of functionalities assessed over several milestone checkup sessions. 

Project Outcome
The project was a success, and I achieved a high score of 95% for the assignment, reflecting my skills and proficiency in various web technologies and their practical applications.

Feel free to explore the code and provide any feedback or ask any questions. Your insights are always welcome!
